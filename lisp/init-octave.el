;;; Usage.
;; Tip 2, change comment style

;; For example, use double slashes (//) instead of slash-stars (* â€¦ *)
;; in c-mode.

;; Insert below code into your ~/.emacs:

;; (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
;;   (lambda ()
;;     ;; Preferred comment style
;;     (setq comment-start "// "
;;           comment-end "")))

;; Note that since I use ac-octave from elpa and code of ac-otave is
;; not included in the git repo, you need to change source in
;; elpa/ac-octave to make sure the repo works. More specifically,
;; ac-octave will check your version number and if it is less than
;; 24.4, it will try to include octave-inf.el. Disable the version
;; check and always try to load the new octave.el.
